How does country of origin impact the average altitude of coffee grown from farms in that country? (Bar graph)

For the first question, the bar graph just gave a good visualization of different altitudes of plantations. This is kind of interesting to see how altitudes might affect the flavor profiles of coffee beans from that country. For example, Ethiopia has a very high altitude but Brazil and Taiwan are lower on the other hand. 

What factors have the highest correlation with CQI’s total cup points? (Scatter plot with correlation)
 
Since the altitude and moisture data sets have a few outliers, I think the correlation there isn’t as prominent or statistically significant. However, for the defect one, the data points are more evenly spread out and there is a clear correlation that with more defects the TCP rating is lower. So our question is answered, defects have the highest negative correlation with TCP.


How does moisture affect the number of defects found in coffee? (Scatter plot)

This question is the one that I think I didn’t succeed in answering. To clarify, defect 1 is visible defects on the beans and defect 2 are defects that can only be noticed after drinking the coffee itself. Since the majority of the coffee plantations produced beans with no defects, the actual sample size for moisture/defect isn’t that large. However, we can still tell that defect 2 is kind of evenly distributed over 8 - 14% of moisture on the plantation, so maybe moisture isn’t a large factor on defects. 

How to find the best coffee?
The conclusion I got from this project is that, maybe there isn’t an exact scientific method of finding the very best coffee beans. As long as it’s from a good plantation, the altitude or moisture doesn’t seem to affect the quality of the coffee very much. So the best way to find coffee might be just simply trying out new beans and figuring out what you like the most.
